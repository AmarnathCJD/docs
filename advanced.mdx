## Roadmap

Gogram is continuously evolving to provide cutting-edge security and privacy features for Telegram automation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Perfect Forward Secrecy" icon="lock">
    Enhanced cryptographic security ensuring that session keys cannot be compromised even if long-term secrets are exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="End-to-End Secret Chats" icon="user-lock">
    Native support for Telegram's secret chats with client-to-client encryption, self-destructing messages, and no server storage.
  </Card>

## Why These Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)" icon="shield-halved">
    PFS ensures that even if an attacker compromises your current session keys, they cannot decrypt past communications. Each session uses unique, ephemeral keys that are discarded after use.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Past messages remain secure
    - Session compromise is isolated
    - Enhanced privacy guarantees
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secret Chats Support" icon="comments">
    Secret chats provide end-to-end encryption directly between clients, bypassing Telegram's cloud infrastructure entirely. Messages are encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted by the recipient.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - True end-to-end encryption
    - Self-destruct timers
    - No message forwarding
    - Screenshot notifications
    - No cloud backup
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
